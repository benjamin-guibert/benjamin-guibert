# Benjamin Guibert — *Software Engineer*

### :bust_in_silhouette: Who am I?

I’ve been into computers since my teenage years, as a high-tech enthusiast. I got seduced by the unforgivable logic there is in programming, which lured me into making it my profession. For the decade I’ve been studying and working as a software engineer, I’ve discovered and assimilated significant skills such as technical architecture, abstract conception, user experience, quality code and respect of best practices. Lately, I’ve grown a strong interest in Web development and blockchain, and am eager to learn more about it, find opportunities in this field, and put all the ensuing expertise into action for promising projects.
